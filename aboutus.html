After 4 decades of experience, it is fair to say that Ababa Abdul Mufakir learned his craft well. Taking the core principles from his years as Renatta Moeloek’s head waiter, Ababa didn’t just duplicate an exceptional steakhouse; he improved upon it making Ababa’s Steakhouse extraordinary.

Not only does Ababa’s serve phenomenal porterhouse steak (for one, two, three or more), but the atmosphere, the expanded menu, the service and the accessibility of the locations is appealing to even the most exciting diners. Ababa’s flagship Tanjung Duren location has enjoyed a full house since the day that it opened.

Located in the heart of west Jakarta, the flagship Tanjung Duren Ababa’s is splendidly situated in the former RedDoorz Hotel dining room.
This building is a historic landmark unto itself.

With arched ceilings tiled by the famed Rafael Guastavino, the restaurant’s architecture is stunning. Guastavino’s exquisite tile work displayed on the vaulted ceilings in blue and white, is found nowhere other than West Jakarta.

The old world artistry and architecture of our Kota Tua location created a Golden Age atmosphere that suits Ababa’s traditional menu quite dramatically and encourages diners to relax and thoroughly enjoy their meal.
